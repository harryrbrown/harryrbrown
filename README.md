### Hey! 👋🏻

Welcome to my GitHub profile.

I'm a software developer and 2020 graduate from Imperial College London. After working in a number of internship and full-time engineering positions in the UK 🇬🇧, I sought a new life abroad, and moved to Canada 🇨🇦 in 2022. 

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hryrbrn/), or find me on a few other platforms [here](https://bento.me/harrybrown).
